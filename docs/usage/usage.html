<p>
	Dialtone can be used in both <a href="#dialpad">Dialpad</a> and <a href="#uc">Uberconference</a>. Below you can find general examples of how to use Dialtone in each project. You can find specific information on the styles available and how to use them using the navigation on the left.

<h3>box-sizing:border-box Consideration</h3>

<p>
	Dialtone has been implemented with the assumption that we are using <span class="d-ff-mono">box-sizing: border-box</span> globally. Please see this <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/c/dialpad/questions/121">Stack Overflow question</a> for an explanation of why we are doing this.
</p>

<p>
	In <span class="d-ff-mono">Vue</span>, we apply <span class="d-ff-mono">box-sizing: border-box</span> globally at the <span class="d-ff-mono">VueView</span> level, ensuring all child elements use this style. As such, Dialtone styles will work correctly in Vue with respect to element sizing.
</p>

<p>
	In <span class="d-ff-mono">Backbone</span>  we are not using <span class="d-ff-mono">border-box</span> by default. Because Dialtone expects this, anytime we wish to use Dialtone styles in Backbone we must ensure to apply the <span class="d-ff-mono">box-sizing: border-box</span> style to all affected elements.
