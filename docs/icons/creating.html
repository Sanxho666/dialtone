<section class="d-layout__stack16">
    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">Most icons in Dialtone are pulled from <a href="https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline" class="d-link">Google’s Material Icon Library</a>. Before introducing a new icon into Dialtone, ask the following questions:</p>
    <ol class="dialtone-copy__normal">
        <li><strong>Is the use of this icon consistent with how it or similar icons are used in Dialtone?</strong><br/>For a consistent, harmonious user experience, icons <strong>need</strong> to be used consistently across Dialpad’s products. An icon that represents one type of content or action in one area, must also be used similarly in another area.</li>
        <li><strong>Can I use another icon already in Dialtone to achieve the same purpose?</strong><br/>Every icon introduced is yet another thing that our users must parse and learn. Whenever possible, consider using a pre-existing icon that captures the essence of what you are trying to communicate and clarify further with a label.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">If you need to add an icon into Dialtone, here’s how you would go about doing that.</p>
    <ol class="dialtone-copy__normal">
        <li><strong>Has the Senior Designer or Design Team approved the use of this new icon in your designs?</strong><br/>If not, the designer should seek that out in a Design Review or 1:1 with their Senior Designer.</li>
        <li>Once approved, the designer needs to add the icon to the Dialtone Icon Figma library file. Instructions for how to properly add an icon into the library file are provided in that file.</li>
        <li>Once added and exported from Figma, create a new branch in Dialtone with the word "icon" in the name.</li>
        <li>Place the exported SVG file(s) in the appropriate folders:
            <ul class="dialtone-copy__normal">
                <li>For system icons: <code class="code-example--inline">./lib/build/svg/system/</code></li>
                <li>For brand icons: <code class="code-example--inline">./lib/build/svg/brand/</code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Open the following file: <code class="code-example--inline">./docs/_data/icon.yml</code>. Add the new icon information at the end of each appropriate section. The icons are sorted alphabetically by the website so there’s no need to place them in the alphabetical order in the data file. Here is an example of  information you must provide is:<br/><br/>
{% highlight yml linenos %}
    - icon: Label
      file: label
      vue: IconLabel
      desc: "Communicates that an item is a label."
{% endhighlight %}
            <br/><ul class="dialtone-copy__normal">
                <li><strong>Icon:</strong> This is the name that will appear on the Dialtone website.</li>
                <li><strong>File:</strong> This needs to be the exact name of the file you placed in either the system or brand svg folder.</li>
                <li><strong>Vue:</strong> This is what the compiled name will be. This is generated by Dialtone, using the above file name. It adds the word Icon with the file name PascalCased next to it. For example, a “label” file would be IconLabel. An “international-calling-alt” file would be IconInternationalCallingAlt.</li>
                <li><strong>Desc:</strong> This is a description about the icon and where it is used. This must be wrapped in quotes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Once finished, run the following command: <code class="code-example--inline">gulp icons watch</code>. This will compile the new icons and update the documentation website.</li>
        <li>Verify your changes have been updated on the website.</li>
        <li>Commit and push your branch to Dialtone.</li>
        <li>Open a pull request.</li>
        <li>Once approved it will be merged.</li>
    </ol>
