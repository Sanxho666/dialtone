    <p class="dds-docs--copy">The line height utility classes use an abbreviated syntax. Based on the CSS property name (<strong>l</strong>ine-<strong>h</strong>eight) and the desired t-shirt size. Below is a table outlining the classes and their meanings:</p>
    <table class="d-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th scope="col" width="20%">Class</th>
                <th scope="col">Output</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            {% for item in site.data.type.line-height %}
            <tr>
                <th scope="row" class="d-ff-mono d-text-xxs">{{ item.class }}</th>
                <td class="d-ff-mono d-text-xxs">{{ item.output }}</td>
            </tr>
            {% endfor %}
