    <p class="dds-docs--copy">These CSS utility classes are based on Dialtone's <a href="/constants/spacing">spacing units</a>. Components will typically set a default padding, which is preferred. However components should not create extranenous modifying classes for increasing padding when these utility classes can achieve the same goal. For that reason it is recommended any padding modifications should be done <strong>using these classes</strong>.</p>
