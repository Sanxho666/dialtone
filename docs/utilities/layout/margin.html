<section class="dds-docs--section">
    <p class="dds-docs--copy">These CSS utility classes are based on Dialtone's <a href="/constants/spacing">spacing units</a>. Generally margins are used for layout purposes, visually separating objects for the user. However the visual separation required for items changes contextually enough that it is recommended that <strong>margins should only be declared using these classes</strong>. This separation of concerns allows an object to dictate only its visual appearance and leave how it lays out to a particular view.</p>
