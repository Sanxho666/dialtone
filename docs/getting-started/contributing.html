    <h2 class="dialtone-title__subsection">Things to Consider</h2>
    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">Before contributing to Dialtone, it is important to consider if your changes belong here or in the particular project using the styles.</p> 
</div>

<div class="dialtone-section2">
    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">Some examples of good candidates for Dialtone:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Updates to existing Dialtone styles</li>
    	<li>Changes or additions to 'base level' styles appling across features</li>
    	<li>Styles that are already being shared across features but are not in Dialtone</li>
    	<li>Styles that are (highly) likely to be reused in future features</li>
    	<li>Additions to definitions such as new color palettes, headers, etc.</li>
    </ul>    
</div>

<div class="dialtone-section2">
    <h2 class="dialtone-title__subsection">Steps to Contribute</h2>
    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">The first step is to verify if your changes should be in Dialtone by pinging one of the contributors. They should be able to quickly help determine if it makes sense.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialtone-section2">
    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">Once verified, determine how to structure your changes such that they follow the same patterns and conventions as existing Dialtone definitions. For now, the best way to do this is to look at some existing Dialtone styles that are similar to the ones that you wish to add.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialtone-section2">
    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">When your changes are ready, commit your changes on a new Dialtone branch, push the branch to remote and submit a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/dialpad/dialtone/pulls" target="_blank">Dialtone GitHub page</a>. Please include a description of the changes and why you think they should be in Dialtone. Optionally, assign a member of the team to review the PR.</p>
</div>

<div class="dialtone-section2">
    <p class="dialtone-copy__normal">Once your PR has been accepted you are free to merge it. In order for your changes to be available in Dialpad, the package version must be updated and the project must be republished onto NPM. For now, the Dialtone contributors will periodically take care of this. If you need your changes by a particular date please let them know within your pull request.</p>
