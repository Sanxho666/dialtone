# Dialpad Design

Dialpad Design is the home for Dialtone, Dialpad's design system. It includes the resources needed to create consistent, predictable interfaces that conform to Dialpadâ€™s design principles, language, styles, and best practices.

**This is under construction.**

## Building Dialtone locally

Here's how to build Dialtone locally:

### Install Ruby via Homebrew:

In order to run Jekyll, you will need a full Ruby development environment. If you don't have this, install Ruby using Homebrew with the steps below. If you already have a Ruby environment installed, move on to the next step.

```
brew install ruby
brew install brew-gem
brew gem install bundler
```

### Clone the repo

First download the repo to your machine:

```
// SSH
git clone git@github.com:dialpad/dialtone.git

// HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/dialpad/dialtone.git
```

Then `cd` into the Dialtone directory:
```
cd /dialtone
```

### Install Gulp

This assumes Node and NPM are already installed. If you don't have these installed, *please install those first.* If you do have Node and NPM installed, proceed with installing gulp:

```
npm install gulp
```

### Install Bundler & Jekyll

Dialtone currently uses Jekyll, a static HTML generator, to build its documentation. Use Bundler to install Jekyll and its dependencies.

- Switch to the `docs` folder in the Dialtone directory. `cd docs`
- Install Bundler and Jekyll: `gem install jekyll bundler`
- Install the Bundle: `bundle install`

### Building Dialtone

Once everything is installed, navigate back out of the `docs` folder (`cd ../`) and start your server by typing the following command:

```
gulp
```

Dialtone should now be available at `http://localhost:4000`
