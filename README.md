# Design Tokens for Dialtone

This repository contains the design tokens for Dialpad's design system Dialtone and everything related to building and publishing them.

Design Tokens are all the defined values that are part of the design system, such as color, spacing, typography and more. The goal is to store design tokens as JSON and output and publish them to many different formats (CSS, LESS, Android, iOS, etc) upon build.

This repository is in development and not currently ready for use.
