## Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, **please ask first in [a new issue](https://github.com/dialpad/dialtone/issues/new)**. It's always discouraging to have a pull request declined after putting in the time. To avoid this, outline the problem and proposed solution. This includes a rough example of how you might compose the styles.
